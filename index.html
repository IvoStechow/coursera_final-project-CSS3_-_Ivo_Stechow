    <h2>What is superfood and why are these foods so special?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The introduction of the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfood">"superfood"</a> in 
      the context of healthy eating and food is an expression of the current nutritional 
      trend that favors high-quality foods with special health benefits.</p>

    <p>To date, there is no exact definition of the term “superfood”. As a rule, however, superfoods are natural 
      foods that contain a particularly large number of valuable nutrients (high nutrient density). 
      These natural products often contain a large number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin">vitamins</a>, 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_(nutrient)">minerals</a>, trace elements, special enzymes, 
      antioxidants, essential fatty acids (e.g. omega-3 fatty acids) or secondary plant substances that are necessary 
      and important for our body as well as being health-promoting and/or performance-enhancing.</p>

    <p>Many superfoods - often referred to as “natural multivitamins” - also have a high proportion of unsaturated 
      fatty acids and fiber-rich carbohydrates. The list of foods referred to as “superfoods” is long and mainly 
      includes  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fruit">fruits</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vegetable">vegetables</a>, 
      wholegrain products, medicinal plants & herbs, nuts & seeds and spices & tubers. 
      But other foods such as dairy products are also included.</p>
