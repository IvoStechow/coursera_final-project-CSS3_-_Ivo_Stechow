    <h2>What are the real benefits of superfoods?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Thanks to the special content of various valuable nutrients, phytochemicals and
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_antioxidants_in_food">antioxidants</a>, 
      these natural foods help us to stay fit, healthy and mentally active and provide our body with the 
      best possible care - especially with regard to consistent performance and an intact immune system.</p>

    <p>A major advantage of superfoods is their ability to strengthen the immune system and reduce inflammation 
      in the body (antioxidant effect). Chronic inflammation is often associated with a variety of diseases such 
      as diabetes, cancer and various cardiovascular diseases. Many superfoods contain antioxidants that can help 
      fight free radicals in the body. Free radicals can damage cells and thus increase the risk of chronic 
      inflammation and associated diseases. By eating superfoods, we can therefore not only strengthen our 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system_contribution_to_regeneration">immune system</a>, but also reduce the risk of certain diseases.</p>
