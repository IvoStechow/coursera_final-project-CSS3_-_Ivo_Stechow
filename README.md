eer-graded Assignment: Final Project: Create your site!

In this assignment you will create an original site and then demonstrate the skills you have learned in this course to style the site.  Some of the skills include showing the ability to:

Implement a traditional "Skip To Main Content" link that is only visible on focus.

Ensure that the site has an accessible, attractively styled navigation.

Effectively use the grid and flex property values.

Use the box model to style elements in an attractive manner.

Use validators to ensure that your site is syntactically correct and accessible.

When you are done you will host your site and then complete peer reviews.  The reviews not only provide feedback for your peers, but are a great way for you to see how CSS can generate such different looks for identical HTML code.

Your project will be graded by the careful examination of your code by a peer as well as the "The W3C Markup Validation Service Tool" and the "WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool". Your peers will look for syntactically correct CSS rules.  Did you include the selectors, properties, and values?  Did you check your site for color contrast issues?  Did you link the CSS file correctly in all three HTML pages? 


Step-By-Step Assignment Instructions

- Create your own three pages of HTML code. Every page must have at least one image and at least one of those   pages must have at least five (5) images. You can use the starter code as inspiration, but you should replace any images with your own image.

- Validate your html using the w3validator

- Use the position property and the focus pseudo-class to style your "Skip to Main Content" link.  It should only be visible when the link is in focus.

- Style your navigation in an attractive fashion â€“ use at least three CSS properties

- Style all images using the box model. At a minimum use border, padding, and border-radius.

- Apply the grid property to at least one parent element. Use at least two columns, but feel free to use more!

- Apply the flex property to at least one parent element. The navigation bar is one place to use flex. You can also use it on images if you would like.

- Update at least one element using the hover pseudo-class. Make sure that the hover property does something interesting. I encourage you to do an internet search on some common transitions and try those.

- Implement the nth-child selector. In my example I used this on the flex page where I gave every other image a different border-radius. Don't forget, if you are styling an advanced selector it can be a little trickier to use the pseudo-classes. Work slowly and carefully.

- V- alidate your code using https://wave.webaim.org/ or the wave browser extension.

- Submit your link

- Complete three peer reviews.
